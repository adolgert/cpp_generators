Dave Beazley has a nice talk on using Python generators for system programming.
http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/ I thought the style of code was nice, so I
wondered how to do it in C++. This little project is just an example.

In Python, a generator is an object that computes a new value every time
you call it. Python has a syntax to write functions that are generators
just by using the yield keyword instead of return.

import re
def matches_numeric(file_lines):
	for line in file_lines:
		if re.match('^[0-9 \t\.]$',line):
			yield line

if __name__ == '__main__':
	file_handle=open('infile.txt','r')
	data=matches_numeric(file_handle)
	for line in data:
		print line

How can you do this in C++. One trick that makes the Python function work is
that the function can either return an object on success or signal it is
done by returning None. In C++, an iterator signals its invalid state by matching
to an end() iterator instead of returning a magic result. That's what this sample
C++ code does. It's just a trial.
